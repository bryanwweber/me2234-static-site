Class,

The quiz due on Feb. 19 has been posted, along with the associated example from
the Multiple Feedwater Heater video. Note that you only need to watch the first
few minutes (until it switches to the Jupyter Notebook) to be able to answer the
quiz questions. The rest of the video is there to help you with the homework.

Please remember that HW 2 is due on Gradescope by noon on Thursday, Feb. 14. HW
2 does not contain any plotting problems, but HW 3 (due Feb. 21) will. Please
get started on HW 2 so you can come to office hours with any questions you have.

See you Thursday,
Prof. Weber

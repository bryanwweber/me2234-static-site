title: Exam 1 Take-Home Partner form
type: text
---

As I announced in class last week, Exam 1 will take place next week. There will be two portions of the exam: a take-home portion on problem solving, and an in-class portion on the 28th with short answer and multiple choice conceptual questions.

For the take-home portion of the exam, you are allowed to work with a partner. Please fill out this form to select a partner or tell me that you will work by yourself: [Form Link](https://goo.gl/forms/LMcCIH0Rz3VvXEG82)

Everyone in the class is **required** to fill out that form; it will count as part of your participation grade for the class. The form is due on Thursday, Feb. 21st by 5:00 PM. There are 3 choices for partners: Yes, and you know who your partner is (which will require you to specify their name and NetID); Yes, and you want to be assigned a partner by me; or No, you will work by yourself. If you select the second option, I will inform you of your partner on Friday. The take-home portion of the exam will be distributed on Monday, Feb. 25th and be due by 12:00 PM (noon) on Thursday, Feb. 28th.

Also, the HW2 solutions have been posted on the course website. Please start HW3 and come to office hours with any questions.

See you tomorrow,
Prof. Weber

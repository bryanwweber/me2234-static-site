Class,

The assignment and rubric for Project 1 have been posted on the Course Materials
page of the class website. Please email me with any questions you have about the
projects.

As we discussed in class, you are allowed to work with one other person on the
projects. Everyone in the class must fill out the partner selection form,
whether you would like to work with a partner or not. The partner selection form
is [here](https://goo.gl/forms/dv7EDy2YOdMmSAIH2).

In addition to the project, the quiz due Mar. 26 is posted, HW 6 is posted, the
Exam 1 solutions are posted, and all of the quiz solutions are posted.

Enjoy your break,
Prof. Weber
